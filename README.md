# Walker Flow v1.0
A program that allows you to easily hack the pokewalker

Walker Flow is a python based program that allows you to easily do various pokewalker tasks with the click of a button

----------------------
# Features:
- Convert Route Images and pokemon sprites to and from the .bin format
- Make action replay codes for custom routes through an easy to use UI
-
- *All outputs made from walker flow (Images, .bin files, .dat files, etc) always get placed on your desktop by default*
  
# Future Features:
- Action replay codes to highjack the pokemon you are transfering (i.e make it shiny/lvl 100 during the transfer)
- Custom IR signals for watts, steps, gifts, deleting the pokewalker save, etc
- Auto install custom sprites you convert to .bins with tinke through a single button click

> - Lincoln's course inject is normally a python script you have to manually edit, and then when ran it will produce a usrcheat.dat file. This tool is the main bread and butter for walker flow's AR custom routes, with me only adding some slight tweaks like giving you a UI to use, allowing you to directly get the AR code instead of only the usrcheat.dat file, etc
